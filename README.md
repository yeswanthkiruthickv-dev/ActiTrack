# ðŸ©º ActiTrack â€” Flask Web Application

## ðŸ§­ Overview / Introduction
*ActiTrack* is a Flask-based web application designed to help users track and manage their health data.  
It provides a simple interface for user *registration, login, and personalized dashboard access*.  
Once logged in, users can view and analyze their health information securely, thanks to Flaskâ€™s authentication system and SQLAlchemy ORM.

This project demonstrates:
- Flask web development best practices  
- User authentication with secure password hashing  
- Integration of Flask-WTF forms for input validation  
- A structured, modular design ready for expansion (e.g., adding health metrics, graphs, or API data)
